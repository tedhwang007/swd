# Chapter 02: choosing an effective visual
## 1. **Simple Text**
When you have just a number or two to share, simple text can be a great way to communicate
Think about solely using the number—making it as prominent as possible—and a few supporting words to clearly make your point
## 2. **Tables**
If you need to communicate multiple different units of measure, this is also typically easier with a table than a graph.
One thing to keep in mind with a table is that you want the design to **fade into the background**, letting the **data** take **center** stage. Don’t let heavy borders or shading compete for attention. Instead, think of using **light borders** or simply white space to set apart elements of the table
## 3. **Heatmap**
A heatmap is a way to visualize data in tabular format, where in place of (or in addition to) the numbers, you leverage colored cells that convey the relative magnitude of the numbers.
**color saturation**
## 4. **Graphs**
4 main tpyes: points, lines, bars, and area.<br>
I. **Points**:

> Scatterplot:

II. **Lines**:

> Line graph<br>
> Slopegraph

III. **Bars**:

> Vertical bar chart<br>
> Horizontal bar chart<br>
> Stacked horizontal bar chart<br>
> Waterfall chart

IV. **Area**:
## Avoid: pie charts, donut charts, 3D, and secondary y‐axes
